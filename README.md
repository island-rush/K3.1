Island Rush is a military strategy teaching tool/game for use by DFMI at The United States Air Force Academy. The game is deployed as a web-app, and consists of 2 teams of 4-5 students each playing aginst each other to dominate a domain of islands. Students use lessons of strategy they have learned and put them into practice to demonstrate their knowledge.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Please note that Island Rush is designed and tested on Chrome, and other browsers may work but are not officially recommended or supported.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS is used on both the server and client. NPM is used for installing and dependency tracking. It should, however, be included when you install Node. MySQL is used for the database. This can be installed locally or accessed externally.

```
node
mysql
```

### Installing

This command will install both Server and Client dependencies. Clone the repository, cd into it, and then run this command.

```
npm run fullInstall
```

You should now be able to run the backend server, frontend react server, or both.

### Database

There are many methods of running / hosting a MySQL server. Once the database exists, please create a user/password for the game to use. Set these values in the env variables.

### Development

Backend Server Run

```
npm run devBackend
```

Running the backend allows access to non-game pages, and admin controls

-   /index.html
-   /teacher.html
-   /courseDirector.html
-   /credits.html
-   /troubleshoot.html

Note there are several env variables used by the backend.

-   CD_LASTNAME = Course Director Last Name -> default is "Smith"
-   CD_PASSWORD = Course Director MD5 Password Hash -> default is MD5('asdf')
-   DB_NAME = name of database -> default is 'k3'
-   DB_HOSTNAME = database host -> default is 'localhost'
-   DB_USERNAME = database user -> default is 'root'
-   DB_PASSWORD = database password -> default is ''
-   SESSION_SECRET = optional secret used by session cookies for security
-   NODE_ENV = 'production' or 'development'
-   PORT = server port (typically pre-set in production environments) -> default is 80

Inserting the database tables and creating/deleting games can be accomplished from the /courseDirector page. Login from the homepage with the creditionals used in the env variables. The password used when creating a game is the password used by teachers to login to their /teacher page. Teachers are able activate/deactivate their games, as well as reset the game to have initial pieces on the board.

Frontend (React) Server Run

```
npm run devFrontend
```

Running the frontend allows access to the main /game.html page. If the backend server is running, it will redirect the frontend to the homepage to enforce an authenticated session.

This command will use concurrently to run the frontend and backend simultaneously.

```
npm run dev
```

Please note that production environments will build the client, creating static files in ./client/build for the server to use. If the NODE_ENV is set to 'production', the backend will use this. Otherwise, it will redirect /game to localhost:3000, as this is the default port for the react server. This can be changed in the server.js file. It is possible to manually build the client using the following command.

```
npm run buildClient
```

## Deployment

These commands can be configured inside an automated CICD pipeline, or manually executed on whatever production machine is in use. Please set env variables before executing, and ensure the database is accessable.

```
npm run fullInstall
npm run buildClient
node server
```

Please note that the web.config is currently being used to configure the environment to run on the Azure Cloud.
